# odin-recipes
First ever repo in my life uploaded to github.
Made it while learning Odin Project course - https://www.theodinproject.com/.

By completing this project I've learnt:
- how to use git and github
- basic syntax and structure of html
- how to publish web projects directly from a GitHub repository
